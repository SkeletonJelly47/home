        <p>This project was my first summer project. This meant that we had 3 full months of full week of working, because we had no other classes during the summer. This was a voluntary course named 'Developing a commercial game' where we had to pitch a commercially viable game and then release it at the end of the course. The past 2 game development courses I did programming and now I wanted to try being a designer.</p>

        <p>We gathered a team together and started creating game concepts. One idea emerged of a rogue-lite FPS and we pitched this concept but the 'jury' deemed it's scope to be too big, which it was. So we started to concept another game, this time we made sure it was achievable. One thing lead to another and we have a game about frogs with local couch multiplayer.</p>

        <p>When production started I had no idea of what to do after the frog mechanics were designed. I had thought about designing too narrow-mindedly. When you're the only designer on the team, you have to design everything. And I was pretty bad at it and I didn't do anything about it until it was too late.</p>

        <p>The project however, was a success! We won the Assembly 2018 Game Dev Competition and came second in the Hatch Party Game Competition. It's my first game released on Steam and overall I'm happy with the outcome of the project.</p>
