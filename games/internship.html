        <h2>About CSE</h2>

        <p>I had my mandatory 5 month internship at CSE Entertainment, a Kajaani based company that provides exergaming products and services. I was brought on to the team because of my version control skills, as they were lacking a Git specialist. I got to work with 5 other developers  </p>

        <h2>My tasks & responsibilities</h2>

        <p>My primary task was to develop a new game mode, the cooper's test, to an existing game, runBEAT. It's a Unity game that is played with a motorless treadmill. To achieve this I needed to familiarize myself with a large existing code base. The state of the legacy code was very not very future proof. Most of my time with the project was spent with refactoring and salvaging the legacy code into a maintainable form. This was the biggest bulk of the work by far. Once the refactoring was done, the implementation of the game mode was very straight forward.</p>

        <p>My secondary task was teaching other team members GitFlow version control practices with a short one week mini project. The goal of the project was to showcase ways to allow several developers to work on the same project with GitFlow practices. Previously the team only had a single developer per project working on it at a time. With branching and proper merge tools, these issues were ironed out, allowing multiple developers to properly collaborate on projects.</p>
