		<h2>Programming passions</h2>

		<p>As a programmer my biggest interest is making gameplay mechanics that feel good moment to moment. First project where I felt that we achieved good game feel was Dashbot Ninja. We dedicated time from out schedule to 'add juice' to the game for the first time. In Ron Colt, my job is to make the player animations feel good and responsible. This includes animation canceling, scaling animation speed with attack speed intervals and still keeping the combo re-activation consistent. I must do this while still keeping compatibility with all different animations with relative ease.</p>

		<p>My current passion in programming is state machines. The entirety of Dashbot Ninja is made with state machines and it worked really well for that project, as we knew that the player character can do only one action at a time, and there is not that many transitions from one state to another. We knew what the player character needed to do and it was clear on how to execute it. We're currently doing the same thing with Ron Colt, no multiple overlapping actions, not many transitions between states and so on. This has simplified the look of our code and state enters and exits are standardized, which has eliminated some headaches.</p>

		<h2>Positions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2018 - 2019</li>
				<ul>
					<p>Me and a couple of buddies organized a voluntary code club aimed at first year students to familiarize them with version control, game engines, and IDEs that weren't either teached or we tought that was useful. The club was held once a week after school hours</p>
				</ul>

			<li>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2019 - Current</li>
				<ul>
					<p>We decided to continue the code club as we did last year, although this time doing it unofficially as the last one was endorsed by KUAS. The content remains basically the same as last year but with some slight scheduling improvements</p>
				</ul>
		</ul>
