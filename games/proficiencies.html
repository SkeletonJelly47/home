		<p>TODO:</p>
		<p>Formal education</p>
		<p>My coding passions</p>
		<p>The success of State Machines</p>
		
		<h2>Formal Education</h2>
		<p>Amis</p>
		<p>Ammattikorkea</p>

		<h2>Programming passions</h2>
		<p>Systems</p>
		<p>Mechanics & Game Feel</p>

		<h2>State Machines in Unity</h2>
		<p>Dashbot Ninja</p>
		<p>Ron Colt</p>

		<!--
		<p>My formal education in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences is that of a producer, but I am mainly interested in game design and have taken every opportunity to learn it. In my past projects I have emphasized a healthy work/freetime relationship as well as strong group bonding activities. My strong suites in production are creating watertight schedules and ensuring every part of the team finds motivation in what they're doing.</p>
	
		<p>As a designer, I am most interested in action gameplay systems. I like to establish clear and solid second-to-second gameplay loops first and foremost. My other passion lies in digging deep into mechanical systems and finding out what makes them tick. Things like delving deep into the stats and rules of Dark Souls or Destiny are where I sink most of my time when playing games. It's not unusual to find myself minmaxing most things in games.</p>
	
		<p>The thing I'm currently trying to master is  the ever elusive term game feel and juice in action games. Things like finding all the seemingly invisible factors that go into creating a system where every input feels satisfying to the player.</p>
	
		<p>My superpower as a developer is definitely scoping. Whether it be the entire project, a system or a subsystem. I have the ability to decide which aspect of a given thing is integral and which can be left in the wish list. As a direct result, I find the MVP document the most important when starting pre-production in a project.</p>

		<h2>Positions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2018 - 2019</li>
				<ul>
					<p>Me and a couple of buddies organized a voluntary code club aimed at first year students to familiarize them with version control, game engines, and IDEs that weren't either teached or we tought that was useful. The club was held once a week after school hours</p>
				</ul>

			<li>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2019 - Current</li>
				<ul>
					<p>We decided to continue the code club as we did last year, although this time doing it unofficially as the last one was endorsed by KUAS. The content remains basically the same as last year but with some slight scheduling improvements</p>
				</ul>
