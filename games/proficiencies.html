		<h2>Programming passions</h2>

		<p>As a programmer my biggest interest is making gameplay mechanics that feel good moment to moment. First project where I felt that we achieved good game feel was Dashbot Ninja. We dedicated time from out schedule to 'add juice' to the game for the first time. In Ron Colt, my job was to make the player animations feel good and responsible. This includes animation canceling, scaling animation speed with attack speed intervals and still keeping the combo re-activation consistent. I must do this while still keeping compatibility with all different animations with relative ease.</p>

		<p>My current passion in programming is entity component systems. I'm working on a hobby project made with SDL2 and EnTT. The game is a top down shooter inspired by SNES era arcade shooters. I want to expand my knowledge beyond object oriented programming and ECS is a perfect way for me to do so. During the project I've also learned a bunch of open source technologies like CMake, Clang and Ninja. </p>

		<h2>Positions</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3>Game Programmer Intern at CSE Entertainment, January - May 2020</h3>
				<ul>
					<p>I did my internship for Kajaani based CSE Entertainment, who create exergaming products and solutions. During my time there I worked on runBEAT, a unity game that is operated by running on a treadmill. I got to work with an existing code base that was deployed all over the world. My task was to add a new game mode to the game, the cooper's test. In addition to this I refactored a huge part of the existing code structure into a maintainable form. My other task was being the Git designated guru and manage the branching flow of multiple projects, and help with various issues when they appeared. </p>
				</ul>

			<h3>Game development summer intensive course at KUAS, Teacher, 2018 & 2019</h3>
				<ul>
					<p>I ran a one week intensive course on game development with Unity, with the goal of students making a small finished game. The course consisted of 2 days of instructed lecturing where the students learned the basics of Unity and C# programming. The rest of the course, students developed a small game either following an example project that I instructed live or they could develop their own idea, depending on their existing know-how. At the end of the course, every student completed a small game and did a small presentation on how they did it. The course attendees had some international students so all of the lecturing was in english.</p>
				</ul>

			<h3>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2018 - 2019</h3>
				<ul>
					<p>Me and a couple of buddies organized a voluntary code club aimed at first year students to familiarize them with version control, game engines, and IDEs that weren't either teached or we tought that was useful. The club was held once a week after school hours</p>
				</ul>

			<h3>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2019 - 2020</h3>
				<ul>
					<p>We decided to continue the code club as we did the previous year, although this time doing it unofficially as the last one was endorsed by KUAS. The content remains basically the same as last year but with some slight scheduling improvements</p>
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h2>Agile</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Scrum, Kanban & Scrumban</li>
			<ul>
				<li>I have a little over 4 years of experience with agile methodologies. My favourite project management style is Scrumban.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
