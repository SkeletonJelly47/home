        <p>In this project I worked as a gameplay programmer and my responsibilites were the player mechanics and loot system. To make the player mechanics, I yet again applied a finite state machine. At first it seemed like a perfect fit for the use case. And at first it was, the difference compared to Dashbot Ninja was the amount of transitions between states. In the end the solution worked but it was not nearly as elegant as I would've liked.</p>

        <p>My biggest challenge was to create a pseudo-random loot system, that was based on loot piles that can be thought as shuffled card decks. The goal of the system was to make loot drops more deterministic. The hardest part of the process was being on top of the various layers of complexity that this structure brought. After some trial and error the system was complete and worked as intended.</p>

        <p>The game was meant to launch on Steam for the holiday season 2019. Unfortunately the game was overscoped and we didn't have a complete gameplay loop for the project to be commercially viable.</p>
