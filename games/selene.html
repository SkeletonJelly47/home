        <h2>Elevator pitch</h2>
        <p>In Selene you crash-land on the surface of the moon, only to find an abandoned moon base. You set out to find out what happened. It was an experiment on developing a narratively driven game where the main goals were meaningful exploration, environmental storytelling and light puzzle elements.</p>

        <h2>Project lifetime</h2>
        <p>After my previous school project, I was a bit fed up with programming. So I decided it was time to try the last thing I wanted to before there are no more school projects: Sound design! My team was accepted the idea of me being a sound designer and we started brainstorming the game. After the concept of the moon game had emerged we thought that there was enough tasks for a dedicated sound designer.</p>

        <p>Production started and everyone got to work with their own tasks. No environments were set in stone yet my tasks were limited. So I started drafting ideas for compositions. In hindsight I spent way too much time on this task and could have started recording sound effects much earlier. This was all due to my inexperience as a sound designer.</p>

        <p>The reason why the project never came to a product was insufficient planning of the programming side of things and not merging branches for weeks at a time. So we ended up in a merge conflict hell and the project was nearing it's end. Overall I'm happy with the project and it was a good try out for sound design for myself.</p>
