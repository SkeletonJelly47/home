				<h2>Mikko Peltola,<br> Game Programmer</h2>
				
				<p> I'm currently on my last year of studies at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences, 
				looking to secure an internship as a game designer.</p>
				
				<p>Born in 1997, I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. 
				They have been with me in inspiring creativity and curiosity towards 
				how things work from mechanical systems all the way to understanding how us humans work as well.</p>
				
				<p>I pride myself on attempting to understanding every side of game development, 
				whether it be production, design, sound, art, programming, QA, you name it. 
				In past projects I have mainly participated as either a producer or designer, but I'm also 
				willing to wield a drawing tablet and a pen or keyboard and Visual Studio as my weapon during development crisis.</p>
				
				<p>When it comes to playing games, I am very much a social gamer. My most enjoyable moments in gaming
				are beating a tough raid for the first time or playing a heart-poundingly close match of PvP with some friends! 
				When it comes to PvP, I'm very competetive and love climbing ranks whether it be in the Crucible in Destiny or Standard format in Hearthstone.
				I used to play Team Fortress 2 competitively in both UGC and ETF2L leagues in the Highlander format and some of my fondest memories ever have come from those matches.</p>
				
				<p>I have a deep love for <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://kirstu.itch.io">game jams</a>. Most of my art and programming experiences come from physically participating at jams at KUAS.
				Most of the time I pick a filler position to round the team or be a jack-of-all-trades type of developer. Last minute SFX and music are my specialty!</p>
			
				<p>Outside of games, I have a strong background in team sports, mainly in soccer. 
				Recently I have been enjoying disc golf as a healthy addition to jogging and cycling.
				During the winter my favourite things to do are downhill skiing and snowboarding! 
				I also love to dabble with electronic music and percussive instruments.</p>
