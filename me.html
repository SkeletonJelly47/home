				<h2>Mikko Peltola, Game Programmer</h2>

				<p>I'm a game programming graduate from Kajaani University of Applied Sciences currently working on <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dodreams.driveahead">Drive Ahead!</a> at <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dodreams/">Dodreams</a>.</p>
				
				<h2>Programming passions</h2>

				<p>As a programmer my biggest interest is making gameplay mechanics that feel good moment to moment. First project where I felt that we achieved good game feel was Dashbot Ninja. We dedicated time from out schedule to 'add juice' to the game for the first time. In Ron Colt, my job was to make the player animations feel good and responsible. This includes animation canceling, scaling animation speed with attack speed intervals and still keeping the combo re-activation consistent. I must do this while still keeping compatibility with all different animations with relative ease.</p>

				<p>My current passion in programming is learning test driven development and behaviour driven development. It's something I haven't seen too widely adopted in game development, and I believe that it could be something that pushes the envelope of software quality in games. In pursuit of knowledge, I enrolled in Dave Farley's <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://courses.cd.training/courses/tdd-bdd-design-through-testing">TDD & BDD - Design Through Testing</a> course. Now I'm keeping up the practice with simple coding katas with <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber-dojo</a>.</p>
				

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology<br>
				Kajaani University of Applied Sciences, 2017 - 2021</p>

				<h3>Software:</h3>
				<p>Visual Studio, Sublime Text, CMake, Git, LaTeX, Reaper, HacknPlan, Jira, Confluence, Trello, Azure Boards, MS Office Suite, Google Docs</p>
				
				<h2>Positions</h2>
				<h3>Game Programmer at Dodreams, January 2022 - Current</h3>
					<p>First full time position in the games industry. Responsibilities include new game modes, monetization and economy features, client / server programming, LiveOps tools and managing build pipelines.</p>

				<h3>Game Programmer Intern at CSE Entertainment, January - May 2020</h3>
					<p>I did my internship for Kajaani based CSE Entertainment, who create exergaming products and solutions. During my time there I worked on runBEAT, a unity game that is operated by running on a treadmill. I got to work with an existing code base that was deployed all over the world. My task was to add a new game mode to the game, the cooper's test. In addition to this I refactored a huge part of the existing code structure into a maintainable form. My other task was being the designated Git guru and manage the branching flow of multiple projects, and help with various issues when they appeared. </p>

				<h3>Game development summer intensive course at KUAS, Teacher, 2018 & 2019</h3>
					<p>I ran a one week intensive course on game development with Unity, with the goal of students making a small finished game. The course consisted of 2 days of instructed lecturing where the students learned the basics of Unity and C# programming. The rest of the course, students developed a small game either following an example project that I instructed live or they could develop their own idea, depending on their existing know-how. At the end of the course, every student completed a small game and did a small presentation on how they did it. The course attendees had some international students so all of the lecturing was in english.</p>

				<h3>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2018 - 2019</h3>
					<p>Me and a couple of buddies organized a voluntary code club aimed at first year students to familiarize them with version control, game engines, and IDEs that weren't either teached or we tought that were useful. The club was held once a week after school hours.</p>

				<h3>Code Club at KUAS, Main Organizer, 2019 - 2020</h3>
					<p>We decided to continue the code club as we did the previous year, although this time doing it unofficially as the last one was endorsed by KUAS. The content remains basically the same as last year but with some slight scheduling improvements.</p>

				<h2>Agile</h2>
				<h3>Scrum, Kanban & Scrumban</h3>
				<p>I have a little over 6 years of experience with agile methodologies. My favourite project management style is Scrumban.</p>

				<h3>Me as a programmer</h3>

				<p>My best skill as a programmer is definitely creating systems to match needs of a game / designer. I feel that I work most efficiently when we've conceived a plan with the programming team, based on the requirements of the designer and aim to match those requirements as efficiently as possible. When I have a goal to work towards I can get there.</p>

				<p>All of that requires good scoping from the programmers and designers which I make sure to be weary of. I always try to keep things as simple as possible to avoid over engineering and to eliminate unnecessary early optimizations. My second best skill is communicating complex systems to other team members, whether or not they are a programmer.</p>

				<p>I have dabbled in sound design in my school game projects, particularly in Selene. I have interest for creating sound effects and sound scapes. For Dashbot Ninja I created most of the sound effects and co-composed the music with another team member.</p>

				<h3>Video games & hobbies</h3>

				<p>I have a diverse history in my gaming life from Arma 3 to drifting in Assetto Corsa. Some of my fondest memories with Arma 3 was being in a "milsim" clan. We had missions and they were always a blast. The feeling of being a part of a big operation and doing your role was very fulfilling. Another big passion of mine is flight simulators. I love free flying in Flight Simulator X and just exploring the world. Doing ridiculously hard helicopter flight paths was just too much fun when you get it just right. </p>

				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ArtsyGiantAirGuitarCoolStoryBro">Drifting</a> is something my friends got into through the Initial D Anime and after watching it, I was hooked. I dug out my old racing wheel and started drifting with my buddies in Assetto Corsa. Occasionally I get my racing wheel out and just relax with some drifting.</p>

				<p>I must thank my older brothers for leaving me a catalog of classics to play in my youth. Some of my favorites are Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2, Turok, Morrowind, Heroes of Might and Magic III and Unreal Tournament 2003. These games are a very important part of my childhood.</p>

				<p>Here are some of my other hobbies: Disc golf, speedrunning, streaming, and playing the piano. I've been into disc golf since 2015. It has been the perfect balance between interest in the game and exercise. Playing the piano has been something I've been doing as a hobbyist for quite some time. I have no formal training, I just learn songs that i want to. I've been speedrunning Titanfall 2 since 2017 and currently placed top 5 (as of May 2023) on the <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://www.speedrun.com/Titanfall_2#Any">Any% leaderboard</a>.</p>
