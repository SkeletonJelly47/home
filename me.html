				<h2>Mikko Peltola,<br> Game Programmer</h2>
				
				<p>I'm on my last year of studies at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences and I'm looking to get an internship as a game programmer.</p>

				<p>My best skill as a programmer is dedinately creating systems to match needs of a game / designer. I feel that I work most efficiently when we've conceived a plan with the programming team, based on the requirements of the designer and aim to match those requirements as efficiently as possible. When I have a goal to work towards I can get there.</p>

				<p>All of that requires good scoping from the programmers and designers which I make sure to be weary of. I always try to keep things as simple as possible to avoid over engineering and to eliminate unnecessary early optimizations. My second best skill is communicating complex systems to other team members, whether or not they are a programmer.</p>

				<p>I have dabbled in sound desing in my school game projects, particularly in Selene. I have interest for creating sound effects and sound scapes. For DashBot Ninja I created most of the sound effects and co-composed the music with another team member.</p>

				<p>I have a diverse history in my gaming life from Arma 3 milsim to drifting in Assetto Corsa. Some of my fondest memories with Arma 3 was being in a "milsim" clan. We had missions in they were always a blast. The feeling of being a part of a big operation and doing your role was so fulfilling. Another big passion of mine is flight simulators. I love free flying in Flight Simulator X and just exploring the world. Doing ridiculously hard helicopter flight paths was just too much fun when you get it just right. </p>

				<p>Drifting is something my friends got into through the Initial D Anime and after watching it too I was hooked. I dug out my old racing wheel and started drifting with my buddies in Assetto Corsa. Occasionally I get my racing wheel out and just relax while drifting.</p>

				<p>I must thank my older brothers for leaving me a catalogue of classics to play in my youth. Some of my favoirites are Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2, Turok, Morrowind, Heroes of Might and Magic III and Unreal Tournament 2003. These games basically are my childhood.</p>

				<p>Here are some hobbies outside of gaming: Disc golf, watching anime classics, and playing the piano. I've been into disc golf since 2015. It has been the perfect balance between interest in the game and exercise. Playing the piano has been something I've been doing as a hobbyist for quite some time. I have no formal training, I just learn songs that i want to.</p>
