			<p>We are currently in late Alpha and are releasing in January 2020!</p>

			while slicing through their robotic henchmen.</p>
			
			<p>This project was a bit different as we only had 3 people in the team in total. Due to the conditions, 
			I mainly worked as an artist, creating the character art and animations, level tilesets, UI and FX. 
			I also made some SFX and music in this one!</p>
			
			<p>It was a great opportunity to see things from a different perspective 
			in a more commercial project instead of a jam game.</p>

				with some pretty whacky physics-based mechanics. Also the characters have tank bodies for legs. It won the Hatch competition of best party game at Assembly 2018!</p> 
				
				<p>This was my first project as a designer for a commercial release.
				I was the only designer in the team, so I got to learn a bunch about all sorts of design. 
				After systems design, most of the work done was centered around level design. </p>

				<h2>Gaming Conference</h2>
				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.northerngamesummit.org">Northern Game Summit (2018)</a> is one of the biggest game conferences in Finland held yearly in Kajaani. In 2018 we had speakers from 
				Blizzard, Santa Monica, Remedy, Guerrilla, CD Projekt Red and more!</p>
				
				<p>I was the Speaker Manager for the event in 2018, 
				being in charge of recruiting speakers for the event as well as organizing travels and accommodation. During the event my task 
				was to make sure we were running in schedule.</p>
				
				<p>Being a major part in organizing this event was probably the most difficult thing I've done to date, 
				but it was also incredibly satisfying to see all my hard work and sleepless nights pay off and culminating 
				in the best games conference in Finland. *cough cough*</p>

				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://kirstu.itch.io/sub-sonar">Sub Sonar (2018)</a> is a global game jam game turned into a personal project. It's a randomly generated, slow paced, audio driven exploration game where you scan the deep sea looking for treasure.</p> 
					
				<p>The theme for the jam was transmission and quickly we decided to make a radar mechanic where you could only see things as visual representations in your radar. I was just learning programming at the time, but I'm very happy with the results. The jam game was nice, but the real gratification came from taking it, polishing it every now and then for a couple months and finally releasing it. There were still a lot of features I wanted to add, but decided against it. I'm glad I did!</p>
