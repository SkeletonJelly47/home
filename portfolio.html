			<h2>Ninja game</h2>
			<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6-KKDm4y3c">Dashbot Ninja (2019)</a> (releasing soon!) is a fast paced Android game where you dash through the office buildings of evil corporates
			while slicing through their robotic henchmen.</p>
			
			<p>This project was a bit different as we only had 3 people in the team in total. I worked as a gameplay programmer on this project, and was responsible for all of the player mechanics. </p>
			
			<p>We scoped the game for our smaller than usual team, and still aimed for a commercial, finished project. We Succeeded in this and the result is my best game I've done to date.</p>

                <p><a class="normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/921720/Frog_Out/">Frog Out! (2018)</a> is a wacky local multiplayer party game for up to 4 players. It's time for you and your friends to find out who is the slickest and the craftiest frog in the pond. Channel your inner frog and jump to victory!</p>
				
				<p>This was my first project where I took on the role of a designer. Up until this project I was always a programmer, and wanted to try being a designer, so I did.</p>
				
				<p>Turned out designing wasn't my thing and I still learned a lot through out the project. We submitted the game to Assembly Game Dev competition and won first place! We also placed second in the Hatch Party Game competition.</p>

				<h2>A narratively driven moon game</h2>
                <p>In <a class="normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQzRONCU8gE">Selene (2019)</a> you crash-land on the surface of the moon, only to find an abandoned moon base. You set out to find out what happened. It was an experiment on developing a narratively driven game where the main goals were meaningful exploration, environmental storytelling and light puzzle elements.</p> 
				
                <p>I worked as a full time sound designer on this project, making sound effects, composing music and implementing it all. The project did not meet it's goal and we cut a lot of stuff along the way. This was our very first narratively driven game as well. I'm still happy with what we accomplished but there definitely was things we could have improved on the communication side of things.</p>
