			<h2>Thesis - Replicating Source Engine Air Strafing in Unity</h2>
						
				<p>I completed my thesis in November of 2021 and is available on <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2021111720476">Theseus.fi</a>. The document is in english.</p>

				<p>The work goes over the history of air strafing, it's various appearances in games, practical usage, the math of air strafing and a game demo made in the Unity game engine. The thesis is made with LaTeX as I wanted to learn a new language and expand my skillset.</p>

				<p>This work now concludes my game programming studies at KUAS and I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology.</p>

			<h2>Internship at CSE Entertainment</h2>
						
				<p>I had my mandatory 5 month internship at <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.cse.fitness/en_US/">CSE Entertainment</a>, a Kajaani based company delivering exergaming products and services.</p>

				<p>I worked on <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0vqJQMXZMw">runBEAT</a>, a Unity game that is deployed all over the world. It's played on a motorless treadmill, and meant to be a more social running experience, since people can run at their own pace while still running side by side.</p>

				<p>While working on the project, I got a lot of experience working with an existing product that contained a lot of legacy code. A substantial portion of my time was dedicated to refactoring the code to make it more maintainable.</p>

				<p>I also got to teach the team GitFlow version control practices with a one week mini project, with all the team members collaborating rapidly.</p>

			<h2>Ninja game</h2>
				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6-KKDm4y3c">Dashbot Ninja (2019)</a> is a fast paced PC game where you dash through the office buildings of evil corporates
			while slicing through their robotic henchmen.</p>
			
				<p>This project was a bit different as we only had 3 people in the team in total. I worked as a gameplay programmer on this project, and was responsible for all of the player mechanics. </p>
			
				<p>We scoped the game for our smaller than usual team, and still aimed for a commercial, finished project. We succeeded in this and the result is my best game I've done to date. The game launched on <a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1193950/Dashbot_Ninja/">Steam</a> and Google Play Store simultaneously.</p>

				<p>Take the leading role of action hero RON COLT in the bizarre stage play of the same name and kick the butts of your foes in the violent acts of the show collecting powerful artifacts for combining and bolstering your powers to cope with the ever-increasing difficulty of the play chapters twisted by the gameplay modifiers.</p>
			
				<p>In this project I worked as a programmer and I was responsible for the player mechanics and loot system.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately this project did not meet it's production goal and was never released.</p>

        	<p><a class="normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/921720/Frog_Out/">Frog Out! (2018)</a> is a wacky local multiplayer party game for up to 4 players. It's time for you and your friends to find out who is the slickest and the craftiest frog in the pond. Channel your inner frog and jump to victory!</p>
				
					<p>This was my first project where I took on the role of a designer. Up until this project I was always a programmer, and wanted to try being a designer, so I did.</p>
				
					<p>Turned out designing wasn't my thing and I still learned a lot through out the project. We submitted the game to Assembly Game Dev competition and won first place! We also placed second in the Hatch Party Game competition.</p>

				<h2>A narratively driven moon game</h2>
          <p>In <a class="normal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQzRONCU8gE">Selene</a> you crash-land on the surface of the moon, only to find an abandoned moon base. You set out to find out what happened. It was an experiment on developing a narratively driven game where the main goals were meaningful exploration, environmental storytelling and light puzzle elements.</p> 
				
          <p>I worked as a full time sound designer on this project, making sound effects, composing music and implementing it all. The project did not meet it's goal and we cut a lot of stuff along the way. This was our very first narratively driven game as well. I'm still happy with what we accomplished but there definitely was things we could have improved on the communication side of things.</p>
